# Add test coverage for [module/component]

## Overview
We need to add test coverage for [module/component], starting with the [specific] functionality.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create necessary test files/directories
- [ ] Add test cases for [specific functions/features]
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure tests are incorporated into the CI pipeline

## Implementation Details
- Tests should use Bun's built-in test runner
- Focus on unit testing the [specific] functions first
- Use the existing bunfig.toml test configuration which already has coverage enabled
- Test files should follow the pattern of `{filename}.spec.ts`

## Why
Improving test coverage will help catch regressions and ensure the reliability of the [module/component], which [explain importance to the project].
